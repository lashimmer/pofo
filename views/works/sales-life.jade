          .body-section-content

            p My client was a tech lead at Gensquared, a big data company that uses AI to surface customer insights to help maximize their sales. He wanted to explore a product solution that he could take to market and scale, targeted specifically to field sales representatives.

            p Together, we worked to research the user needs, and came up with a plan to develop an MVP. I designed and prototyped the tablet experience for a CMS with scheduling features and a recommendation system.

            h2 The problem
          .body-section-content
            p Sales people want to be as effective as possible with their time. A significant part of their day is spent working with large amounts of customer data, trying to draw insights to either find new leads or upsell existing customers.

            p For field sales reps, an added challenge is that much of their week is spent traveling on the road, getting from one customer location to another. Often these visits are for potential leads, and a lot of research needs to be done beforehand to identify the opportunity and form a sales strategy.

            h2 Research
          .body-section-content
            p Gensquared already had its first customers in mind, so I was able to speak directly to the sales reps who would potentially be using the product. I ended up chatting with 11 sales reps in total, deep diving into their existing workflow, the tools they used, and the pain points they currently had.

            p Here were the key insights:

            ul
              li
                b Planning and research was always done ahead of time.
                |  There was little to no time to plan or research while traveling on the road in their cars. Users reported spending at least an hour on weekends just planning routes.
              li
                b Internet access was limited and inconsistent while on the road.
              li
                b Sales reps were using up to ten different tools to get all the information they needed.
                |  These included CMS systems, calendars, maps, and offline note-taking applications. On tablet and mobile, the context-switching was messy, and the official CMS systems often didn't get updated with new information.
              li
                b When selecting leads to visit, geography was the most important factor, followed by sale potential.
                |  Maintaining existing customers also generally took priority over new customer acquisition and expansion. Users also admitted to not having the time, skill, or resources to effectively research new leads.

            h2 The MVP
          .body-section-content
            p To really maximize the sales reps' time, we wanted to not only make their planning more efficient and effective, but also ease some of their execution pains.

            p We liked the idea of packaging the entire experience into a single app, designed to support offline data entry and pre-download relevant customer data. My client could sell the experience as a package to businesses where easing these pain points are critical in making sales. Our app would bring the most value to sales reps who had limited time to spend on planning and research.

            p Ultimately, these were the product features we landed on for our CMS tool:

            ul
              li
                b A geography-based scheduling tool
                |  to let sales reps plan their week.
              li
                b A feedback section
                |  to record how customer pipelines progress.
              li
                b  A notification-based recommendation system
                |  to surface leads that are tailored to fit their existing travel routes, and next-best customer actions that are digestible and relevant.
              li
                b Curated customer data and analytics screens
                |  to prioritize forward-looking insights.
              li
                b Personalized statistics and quarterly sales data
                |  to track and improve the sales rep's own KPI's.

            p The first three features were prioritized for proof-of-concept and prototyped for tablet, because we knew that was the device of choice of our potential first customers.

            h5 Recommendations as notifications

            p We thought of a lot of ways we could present the AI recommendations to sales reps. The major categories of insights we could surface included the following:

            ul
              li
                b Leads:
                |  mining customer data to provide potential new customers.
              li
                b Pipeline:
                |  predicting win rates and which levers to close, and when.
              li
                b Outreach:
                |  predicting the best times to contact and meet new and existing customers.
              li
                b Churn:
                |  determining the health of existing customers and forecasting churn.
              li
                b Segments:
                |  surfacing and exploring customer segments.

            p To really keep things simple for the sales reps, I wanted to surface the right information at the right time, so it would be more likely to be acted upon.

            h5 User flows

            p I mapped out the user's touchpoints with the app, along with the major flows in the MVP:

            ul
              li Viewing their schedule
              li Scheduling an event
              li Searching for a specific customer
              li Checking a notification, which would take them to the relevant context
              li Recording notes after a meeting
              li Viewing a customer's account
              li Viewing trends across all customer accounts

            .img-container
              .caption User journey (green for actions, yellow for views)
              img(src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/process/user-journey.png')

            p The planner flow was the primary use case by far, and I wanted to take advantage of the screen real estate of a tablet by having the relevant planner contexts visible at all times.

            .img-container.medium
              .caption Concept wireframe
              img(src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/process/wireframe.png')

            p All the other flows, when triggered, would slide in to fill the center space, keeping the user grounded in the planner context at all times.

            h5 The planner

              .caption Default planner view, with weekly statistics toggled.

            p Users would be able to see their entire route mapped out in consecutive order, and geographically plan their week. To navigate through the days of the week, they could either swipe or tap the left and right arrows.

            .img-container.outline
              img(src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/planner_t04.png')
              .caption Quick jump to a different date.

            p A prototype of this experience:

              source(src='movie.ogg', type='video/ogg')
              | Your browser does not support the video tag.

            h5 Scheduling accounts

            p Accounts that were triaged into the planner for scheduling would appear in a fixed "scheduling" container, with corresponding markers on the map so users could compare locations and see what made sense to add to the day's schedule.

            p A simple drag and drop mechanism would add the account to the schedule of the date that the user was currently viewing. To make the mechanism more learnable, I included a small line of instructions under each section to prompt user interaction.

            .img-container.outline
              img(src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/planner_t03.png')

              | Your browser does not support the video tag.

            h5 Searching for an account

            p The search function was accessible through the side navigation. Tapping it brought out a context card that would start the user out with their most recently viewed customers.

            .img-container.outline
              img( src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/search_t01.png')
              .caption Search with starting recommendations.

            p As the user typed, the most relevant results would update until the query was specific enough to find the correct account. Users could tap into the accounts to pull up their information, or use the quick actions to triage them immediately for scheduling.

            .img-container.outline
              img( src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/search_t02.png')

              .caption A mockup of the customer account details.

            p Here's a prototype of the search experience, interacting with the module for seeing trends across all customer data.

              | Your browser does not support the video tag.

            h5 Giving feedback on a customer interaction

            p One of the pain points we heard involved interacting with the CMS, and how data-entry friction was so high that they were rarely being updated at all.

            p I wanted to brainstorm ways the user experience could be improved. One of the ideas we came up with was a voice-to-text note taker, so the sales reps' immediate reactions to customers could be captured more easily. Making sure the technology allowed for offline, asynchronous data entry would be critical so sales reps could use it even while rushing to their next appointment.

            .img-container.outline
              .multiple.desktop
                img( src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/feedback_t01.png')
                img( src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/feedback_t02.png')

                img( src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/feedback_t04.png')

            p Encouraging good data-entry practices was valuable for companies if they ever needed to onboard new sales people to existing customers to catch them up on existing relationships.

            p The prototype:

            video.outline(controls controlslist='nodownload' disablePictureInPicture loop)

              | Your browser does not support the video tag.

            h5 Notifications list

            p As much as possible, we wanted to have notifications take users directly to the context of the message.

            ul
              li For newly surfaced leads and customer insights, it would take them to the correct accounts page.
              li Prompts to show customer details or prompt feedback would open the right flows, and could be triggered by tracking the user's GPS location.

            p For customer insights, we included the option for a notification to be "snoozed", in case a user knew they wouldn't have time to schedule it in for the current week.

            .img-container.outline
              .multiple.desktop
                img( src='../img/2019/works/sales-life/mocks/notifications_t01.png')

            p More granularly, tracking click throughs and comparing them to changes in customer churn and acquisition could help improve the UX of the app through its future product iterations, as well as the AI recommendation algorithm.
